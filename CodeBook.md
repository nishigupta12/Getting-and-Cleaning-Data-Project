## Code Book For Tidy Data Set (course project)
This code book describes the variables in the tidy data set (TidySet.txt).  The analysis steps are in the README.md file.

### Variable 1
Variable 1 (in column 1) = subject:  subject number of test volunteer, ranging from 1 to 30. Each of the 30 volunteers performed 6 activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II).

### Variable 2
Variable 2 (in column 2) = activity: type of activity performed during the test.  The data is ordered in the activity sequence listed below. The type # refers to the number in the source files but is not listed in this column to improve readability (e.g., it is descriptive).
* WALKING (activity type #1)
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (activity type #2)
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (activity type #3)
* SITTING (activity type #4)
* STANDING (activity type #5)
* LAYING (activity type #6)

There is 1 set of observations per volunteer and activity combination (180 rows).

### Background On Observations In Original Source Files
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### Tidy Data Set:  Subset of Observation Variables
This is a subset of the total original observations.  It includes all the variables where "mean", "Mean", or "std"" (standard deviation) show up in the variable name.

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

###  Tidy Data Set: Variable Names
Variables 3 - 81 (columns 3 - 81) = These are the subset of variables that include mean and std in their names.  The colummn names were simplified to make them more descriptive.  The - and () were removed and first letters of mean and std were capitalized for consistency.
